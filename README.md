 I am a research associate (postdoc) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research focuses on efficient machine learning and computer vision for robotics. These days, I am particularly interested in physics-informed neural networks to combine machine learning and control approaches for learnning residual dynamics. Moreover, I have been developoing deep learning approaches for visual object perception, segmentation and grasp pose prediction in highly cluttered environments. I have evaluated my works on different robotic platforms, including Nextage, robotic arms (UR5, Franka), and humanoid robots.
