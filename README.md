 I am a research associate (postdoc) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research focuses on efficient machine learning and computer vision for robotics. These days, I am particularly interested in physics-informed neural networks to combine machine learning and control approaches for learnning residual dynamics. Moreover, I have been developoing deep learning approaches for visual object perception, segmentation and grasp pose prediction in highly cluttered environments. I have evaluated my works on different robotic platforms, including Nextage, robotic arms (UR5, Franka), and humanoid robots.

    <td> <b> + Learning Hybrid Locomotion Skills â€“ Learn to Exploit Residual
Dynamics and Modulate Model-based Gait Control:</b> <br>
    This work aims to combine machine learning and
control approaches for legged robots, and developed a hybrid
framework to achieve new capabilities of balancing against
external perturbations. The framework embeds a kernel which is
a fully parametric closed-loop gait generator based on analytical
control. On top of that, a neural network with symmetric partial
data augmentation learns to automatically adjust the parameters
for the gait kernel and to generate compensatory actions for all
joints as the residual dynamics, thus significantly augmenting
the stability under unexpected perturbations.
