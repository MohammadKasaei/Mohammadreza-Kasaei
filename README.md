 I am a research associate (postdoc) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).  My research focuses on efficient machine learning for robotics including deep reinforcement learning and computer vision. These days, I am particularly interested in neural ODE and its applications in developing scalable imitation learning algorithms, physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to learn residual dynamics and residual actions, also deep learning approaches for visual object perception, segmentation and grasp pose prediction in highly cluttered environments. I have evaluated my works on different robotic platforms, including Nextage, robotic arms (UR5, Franka), legged robots (biped and quadruped) and soft robots.

    <p align="justify">
    Robots operating in human-centric environments require the integration of visual grounding and grasping capabilities to effectively manipulate objects based on user instructions. This work focuses on the task of referring grasp synthesis, which predicts a grasp pose for an object referred through natural language in cluttered scenes. Existing approaches often employ multi-stage pipelines that first segment the referred object and then propose a suitable grasp, and are evaluated in simple datasets or simulators that do not capture the complexity of natural indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we develop a challenging benchmark based on cluttered indoor scenes from OCID dataset, for which we generate referring expressions and connect them with 4-DoF grasp poses. Further, we propose a novel end-to-end model (CROG) that leverages the visual grounding capabilities of CLIP to learn grasp synthesis directly from image-text pairs. Our results show that vanilla integration of CLIP with pretrained models transfers poorly in our challenging benchmark, while CROG achieves significant improvements both in terms of grounding and grasping. 
    Extensive robot experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging interactive object grasping scenarios that include clutter.

    <td> <b> + A Data-efficient Neural ODE Framework for Optimal Control of Soft Manipulators:</b> <br>
    <p align="justify">
    This work introduces a novel approach for modeling continuous forward kinematic models of soft continuum robots by employing Augmented Neural ODE (ANODE), a cutting-edge family of deep neural network models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of ANODE in modeling soft continuum robots. This formulation introduces auxiliary dimensions, allowing the system's states to evolve in the augmented space which provides a richer set of dynamics that the model can learn, increasing the flexibility and accuracy of the model. Our methodology achieves exceptional sample efficiency, training the continuous forward kinematic model using only 25 scattered data points.
 Additionally, we design and implement a fully parallel Model Predictive Path Integral~(MPPI)-based controller running on a GPU, which efficiently manages a non-convex objective function. Through a set of experiments, we showed that the proposed framework (ANODE+MPPI) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art learning based methods such as FNN and RNN in unseen-before scenarios and marginally outperforms them in seen-before scenarios.

This work develops a data-efficient learning from demonstration framework which exploits the use of rich tactile sensing and achieves fine dexterous bimanual manipulation. Specifically, we formulated a convolutional autoencoder network that can effectively extract and encode high-dimensional tactile information. Further, we developed a behaviour cloning network that can learn human-like sensorimotor skills demonstrated directly on the robot hardware in the task space by fusing both proprioceptive and tactile feedback. Our comparison study with the baseline method revealed the effectiveness of the contact information, which enabled successful extraction and replication of the demonstrated motor skills.

    <p align="justify">
The work introduces a novel framework, named TiV-ODE, which enables the generation of highly controllable videos using a static image and text caption. The framework relies on the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to represent complex underlying dynamical systems through a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The proposed method generates videos that possess both the desired dynamics and content. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in producing visually consistent and highly controllable videos while modeling dynamical systems. This work represents a significant advancement towards developing advanced models for generating controllable videos that can handle complex and dynamic scenes.

    <p align="justify">
In this work, we propose a multi-view deep learning approach to handle robust object grasping in human-centric domains. In particular, our approach takes a point cloud of an arbitrary object as an input, and then, generates orthographic views of the given object. The obtained views are finally used to estimate pixel-wise grasp synthesis for each object. We train the model end-to-end using a synthetic object grasp dataset and test it on both simulation and real-world data without any further fine-tuning.

    <p align="justify"> This work developed a kernel-based residual learning framework for quadrupedal robotic locomotion. Initially, a kernel neural network is trained with data collected from an MPC controller. Alongside a frozen kernel network, a residual controller network is trained via reinforcement learning to acquire generalized locomotion skills and resilience against external perturbations. With this proposed framework, a robust quadrupedal locomotion controller is learned with high sample efficiency and controllability, providing omnidirectional locomotion at continuous velocities. Its versatility and robustness are validated on unseen terrains that the expert MPC controller fails to traverse. Furthermore, the learned kernel can produce a range of functional locomotion behaviors and can generalize to unseen gaits.

This work proposed a novel Single-Stage Grasp (SSG) synthesis network, which performs high-quality instance-wise grasp synthesis in a single stage: instance mask and grasp configurations are generated for each object simultaneously. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art on robotic grasp prediction based on the OCID-Grasp dataset, and performs competitively on the JACQUARD dataset. The benchmarking results showed significant improvements compared to the baseline on the accuracy of generated grasp configurations.

During the course of the competition, the team scored 84 goals while conceding only 2. FC Portugal also won the 2022 RoboCup 3D Simulation League Technical Challenge, accumulating the maximum amount of points by ending first in its both events: the Free/Scientific Challenge, and the Fat Proxy Challenge. The team presented in this year’s competition was rebuilt from the ground up since the last RoboCup. No previous code was used or adapted, with the exception of the 6D pose estimation algorithm, and the get-up behaviors, which were re-optimized. In comparison with our previous team, the omnidirectional walk is more stable and went from 0.70 m/s to 0.90 m/s, the long kick from 15 m to 19 m, and the new close-control dribble reaches up to 1.41 m/s.

The framework embeds a kernel which is a fully parametric closed-loop gait generator based on analytical control.
