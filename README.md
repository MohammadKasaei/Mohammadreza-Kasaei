 I am a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh. My research focuses on efficient machine learning and computer vision for robotics. These days, I am particularly interested in physics-informed neural networks to learn residual dynamics, and also deep learning approaches for visual object perception, segmentation and grasp pose prediction in highly cluttered environments. I have evaluated my works on different robotic platforms, including Nextage, robotic arms (UR5, Franka), and humanoid robots.
